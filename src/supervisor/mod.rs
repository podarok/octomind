//! Supervisor — the out-of-band control plane around the agent loop.
//!
//! Runs *beside* the main loop, never in the user's transcript. Hosts:
//! - `learning` — distill (end-of-trajectory lessons) + recall (inject).
//! - orientation — a second memory kind: durable understanding of the subject
//!   (decisions, structure, constraints), stored as `memory_type = "orientation"`,
//!   managed inside `learning`.
//! - detectors — deterministic, free, every turn: loop / no-progress / recovery.
//!   Fused with the agent's own self-report token before any model is woken.
//!   Thresholds are fixed constants (`detect::LOOP_THRESHOLD`,
//!   `detect::NO_PROGRESS_WINDOW`) — good defaults, not knobs.
//! - gate — verify-gate on self-reported `done`; labels the run for learning.
//! - condense — task-aware narrowing of oversized tool outputs (line-range
//!   selection, never retyping) so the agent model sees only what the task needs.
//!
//! Invariants:
//! 1. Free signals (counters + self-report) gate the model; model calls are rare.
//! 2. Injections are advisory system-side notes — never silent context rewrites.
//! 3. Out-of-band: status tokens are stripped from display; deliberation never
//!    reaches the user transcript.
//!
//! Config is STRICT: every field below is required. A missing `[supervisor]`
//! section or any missing key is a hard parse error — we own the schema, so we
//! fail loudly instead of degrading to silent defaults.
