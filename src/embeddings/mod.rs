//! Embedding infrastructure — internal model, no user config.
//!
//! Wraps octolib's HuggingFace provider (candle backend, gated behind octolib's
//! `huggingface` feature) with a process-global model singleton and an in-memory
//! cache. Used by capability discovery and tool gating to score natural-language
//! intent against tool/capability descriptions.
//!
//! The model identity is an implementation detail. Users do not configure it
//! and cannot change it: `muvon/octomind-embed`, an all-MiniLM-L6-v2 fine-tune
//! (22M params, 384-dim, CPU-only). Weights are downloaded on first use to the
//! HuggingFace cache directory and reused across runs.
//!
//! No behavior change in this commit — this is the substrate. Capability
//! discovery and tool gating wire it up in subsequent commits.
