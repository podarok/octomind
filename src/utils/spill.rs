//! Spill-to-disk reference handles for over-cap tool output.
//!
//! Plain truncation is LOSSY: the tail is dropped and re-running the same call
//! returns the same capped output — the rest is simply unreachable, which is
//! what drives truncation-retry loops. Spilling instead writes the FULL body to
//! a session-scoped file and hands the model a path handle, turning truncation
//! into lossless just-in-time access: the model reads only the span it needs via
//! its normal file/grep tools. It hooks the single truncation choke point, so it
//! is tool-agnostic. (Cf. Anthropic "code execution with MCP" — lightweight
//! identifiers beat inlining large results into context.)
