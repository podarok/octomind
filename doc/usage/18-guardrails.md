# Guardrails

Use `.agents/guardrails.toml` to transform session input, deny matching tool calls, and run feedback scripts. This guide
is for project authors configuring those rules and checking their execution boundaries.

## Get started

From the project root, create an input-transform script:

```bash
mkdir -p .agents scripts
cat > scripts/prepare-input.sh <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
printf '%s\n' 'Project rule: distinguish observed results from assumptions.'
cat
EOF
chmod +x scripts/prepare-input.sh
```

Add this entry to `.agents/guardrails.toml` (create the file if it does not exist):

```toml
[[pipe]]
name = "prepare"
command = "./scripts/prepare-input.sh"
roles = ["developer"]
```

Start a new session to load it:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'Explain the project rule added to this request.' | octomind run developer:general --format jsonl
```

The pipe prepends the rule to input. The examples below are alternatives or additions to that file; do not combine
multiple catch-all pipes, because a message may match at most one. Script examples assume Unix and their named
interpreter is installed; make each file executable after saving it. `command` and `script` are executable paths, not
shell command strings with arguments.

## Overview

| Section | Phase | What it does | Side effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `[[pipe]]` | Pre-model | Transform or validate user input before the model sees it | Non-zero exit → hard stop; stdout replaces user message |
| `[[guard]]` | Pre-call | Block a tool from running | Synthetic error result returned to the model |
| `[[hook]]` | Post-result | Run a script against the tool result | Non-zero exit → script stdout pushed to the session inbox (delivered as system-managed feedback on a subsequent request) |
| `[[validator]]` | End-of-turn | Run a script after the assistant's final message | Non-zero exit → `<validation>`-wrapped stdout pushed to the session inbox |

All four live in the same file. Nothing is mandatory; missing file = no authored rules. Opt-in generated evolution rules
may still be appended.

**Who can stop vs who can only nudge:** only `[[pipe]]` and `[[guard]]` can *block* — a pipe stops the message before
the model sees it, a guard stops a tool call before it runs. `[[hook]]` and `[[validator]]` can only *nudge*: their
feedback does not undo the tool result; they push a message to the inbox that the model reads on the next turn.

## File location

`<workdir>/.agents/guardrails.toml` — loaded fresh at session start. Parse errors are printed to stderr and treated as
no authored rules; a broken file never crashes the session.

Rules and runtime history are session-scoped. Edits are not hot-reloaded. Start a new session to reload rules and reset
history. `/done` also reloads authored/generated rules when learning is enabled, but does not reset the call log,
validator cursors, pipe counts, or message counter.

## Matching DSL

Used inside `match` (guards, hooks) and inside `when` entries (guards, validators):

```text
capability                       # any call to that capability
capability(regex)                # regex matched against full args JSON
capability(arg_name=regex)       # regex matched against a specific arg
```

- **capability** = the exact MCP capability name resolved from tap manifests or the runtime overlay (e.g. `shell`,
  `filesystem-read`, `filesystem-write`). Matching is equality, not a prefix or fuzzy check: a tool name or MCP server
  name works only if it is also the resolved capability's exact name. Tools with no owning capability never match.
- **regex on full args JSON** = the call's params object serialized to JSON, then matched. Use for any-arg patterns.
- **arg-targeted** = regex matched against just that arg's value. String args matched directly (no quotes);
  arrays/objects/numbers matched against their JSON form. Example: `paths=secret` matches `paths=["a","b/secret.env"]`
  because the haystack becomes `["a","b/secret.env"]`.

> **Two namespaces, one word.** The word "capability" appears in three places with **two distinct meanings**, so be
> careful:
> - In `match` / `when` targets and in the hook payload (`capability` field / `OCTOMIND_CAPABILITY` env) it means a
> **capability name** — the resolved tap-capability that owns the tool (e.g. `shell`, `filesystem-read`).
> - In `[[guard]] has` it means an **MCP server name** — the name of a configured `[[mcp.servers]]` entry active for the
> role (e.g. `core`, `runtime`, `agent`, `filesystem`). These are *not* capability names, so `has = "filesystem-read"`
> works only if that is also an actual configured server name.

### How a tool call resolves to a capability

`match` / `when` targets and the hook `capability`/`OCTOMIND_CAPABILITY` value all use a **capability name**. Octomind
resolves a call's `(server, tool)` pair to that name as follows:

1. **Static tap manifests first** — a `(server, tool) → capability` map is built from every installed capability's
  `allowed_tools`. A capability "owns" a tool when its `allowed_tools` lists `server:tool` (exact) or `server:*`
  (wildcard). Exact `(server, tool)` entries take precedence over `server:*`; the first discovered owner wins within
  each map.
2. **Runtime overlay fallback** — static-server tool extras contributed by runtime capability activation are checked
  next, using exact tool names.
3. **No owner → no match.** A tool without either lookup entry resolves to no capability and cannot match a DSL target.
  Directly configured tools can still have an owner if an installed capability declares their `(server, tool)` pair.

So the capability name for, say, the `view` tool is whatever tap capability lists `filesystem:view` (or `filesystem:*`)
in its `allowed_tools` — not the server name `filesystem`. `/mcp full` shows server/tool names, not the resolved
capability ownership map. Inspect installed capability provider files and, for a live observation, a hook payload’s
`capability` value. The hook below works without a `match` filter, including for local tools that have no capability
owner:

```toml
[[hook]]
on = "any"
script = ".agents/hooks/show-owner"
```

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/hooks
cat > .agents/hooks/show-owner <<'EOF'
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys
payload = json.load(sys.stdin)
print(json.dumps({key: payload[key] for key in ("tool", "capability")}), file=sys.stderr)
sys.exit(1)
EOF
chmod +x .agents/hooks/show-owner
```

Run with `/loglevel debug` and make a tool call. This diagnostic script exits 1 so the hook runner logs stderr; its
empty stdout prevents inbox feedback. Remove the diagnostic hook when finished.

```text
/loglevel debug
Use an available read-only tool to inspect the project directory.
/loglevel info
```

## `when` conditions (signed list)

Used by `[[guard]]` (session-wide history) and `[[validator]]` (since-last-run history). Each entry is one DSL target
with a sign prefix:

```toml
when = [
  "+filesystem-write",                  # was used
  "-shell(command=cargo test)",         # was NOT used
]
```

- `+target` = at least one matching call exists in the relevant history window.
- `-target` = no matching call exists in the relevant history window.

All `when` items are AND'd. History is the session call log of allowed calls, recorded before execution; blocked calls
do not enter it, while a later tool error does not erase an allowed call.

## `pipe` guardrail: Pre-model Input Transform

Runs a matching script on the raw user input **before the model sees it**. The script receives the user message on
stdin; its stdout replaces the message sent to the model. Non-zero exit is a hard stop — the message is not sent to the
model and an error is displayed.

At most one `[[pipe]]` may match per user message; multiple matches are an error.

```toml
[[pipe]]
name    = "prepare"                        # required: identifier
command = "./scripts/prepare-input.sh"       # required: path relative to workdir
match   = ".*"                              # optional: regex on user message text
when    = "any"                             # optional: "first" | "any" (default)
roles   = ["developer"]                    # optional: role filter
```

### Semantics

- Evaluated on every user message (subject to filters).
- Filter evaluation order (cheapest first): `roles` → `when` → `match`.
- At most one pipe may match per message. If two or more pipes match, an error is displayed and the message is not sent
  to the model.
- The pipe runs in the session's working directory.
- Output-wait timeout: 300 seconds (same as hooks and validators); stdin is written concurrently.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | identifier, used in error messages and `PIPE_NAME` env var |
| `command` | path | yes | script path, relative to workdir (or absolute) |
| `match` | regex | no | regex on user message text; empty = matches all messages |
| `when` | enum | no | `"first"` (first message only) or `"any"` (default, every message) |
| `roles` | list of strings | no | role filter; exact (`developer:general`) or domain prefix (`developer` matches `developer:general`; `developer:*` is not a glob) |

### Script contract

| Channel | Use |
|---|---|
| **cwd** | session workdir |
| **stdin** | raw user message text |
| **env** | `OCTOMIND_ROLE`, `OCTOMIND_WORKDIR`, `PIPE_NAME`, `PIPE_RUN_COUNT`, `SESSION_MESSAGE_COUNT` |
| **stdout** | replaces the user message (used as-is, no trimming) |
| **stderr** | logged at debug level; used in the rejection error on non-zero exit |
| **exit 0** | stdout becomes the new user message |
| **exit ≠ 0** | hard stop — error displayed, message not sent to model |
| **timeout** | 300 s; killed → hard stop |

### Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `OCTOMIND_ROLE` | current session role (e.g. `developer:general`) |
| `OCTOMIND_WORKDIR` | session working directory path |
| `PIPE_NAME` | the `name` field from the `[[pipe]]` entry |
| `PIPE_RUN_COUNT` | number of times this pipe has been invoked in this session (starts at `1`) |
| `SESSION_MESSAGE_COUNT` | number of entries through the pipe-processing path, including the current attempt even if no pipe matches or it is rejected; not a count of slash commands |

### Example: validate input format

```toml
[[pipe]]
name    = "validate"
command = "./scripts/validate-input.sh"
```

Save this as `scripts/validate-input.sh` and run `chmod +x scripts/validate-input.sh`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
input=$(cat)
if [[ "$input" != Task:* ]]; then
  printf '%s\n' 'Start the request with Task: followed by the work to do.' >&2
  exit 1
fi
printf '%s\n' "$input"
```

With this pipe replacing the quickstart pipe, try:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'Task: Explain the project layout.' | octomind run developer:general --format jsonl
```

Known slash commands are dispatched separately; a pipe is not a way to forbid `/exit` or `/done`.

### Example: enrich first message with context

Reuse the quickstart script with this pipe instead of the catch-all entry:

```toml
[[pipe]]
name    = "context-enricher"
command = "./scripts/prepare-input.sh"
when    = "first"
roles   = ["developer"]
```
---

## `[[guard]]` — pre-call deny rules

```toml
[[guard]]
match   = "shell(command=^rm\\s+-rf?)"   # required: DSL target on the call
has     = "filesystem"                   # optional: MCP server must be in merged config
when    = ["-filesystem-read"]           # optional: history filter
message = "rm -rf blocked."              # required: shown to the model
```

### Semantics

- Evaluated in declaration order; **first match wins**.
- All conditions AND'd. Rule fires only when:
  - `match` target matches the current call, AND
  - every `has` entry is the name of an MCP **server** in the merged role config, AND
  - every `when` item is satisfied against the session call log.
- **`has` uses MCP server names, not capability names.** It is checked against the set of configured `[[mcp.servers]]`
  entries active for the current role (e.g. `core`, `runtime`, `agent`, `filesystem`) — *not* the capability vocabulary
  used by `match`/`when`. The check reads the merged config’s server names; it does not verify a live connection or
  include every dynamically registered server.
- When the rule fires, the call is **blocked** before the executor runs. The model receives a synthetic tool error:
  `[guardrail] <message>`.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `match` | DSL target | yes | the call to match |
| `has` | string or list | no | configured-MCP-**server**-name filter (e.g. `core`, `filesystem`); empty = no filter. Not a capability name. |
| `when` | list of `+/-target` | no | history filter; empty = no filter |
| `message` | string | yes | the text the model sees |

### Example: tiered shell policy

These examples require installed capability ownership names `shell` and `filesystem-read`, and a configured server named
`filesystem` where `has` is used. They match the literal argument text, not shell semantics; they do not cover every
equivalent destructive command.

```toml
[[guard]]
match   = "shell(command=^rm\\s+-rf?\\s+/)"
message = "Refusing rm -rf on root paths."

[[guard]]
match   = 'shell(command=git push.*(?:--force(?:\s|$)|-f(?:\s|$)))'
message = "Force push blocked. Use --force-with-lease and ask first."

[[guard]]
match   = "shell(command=^ls\\b)"
has     = "filesystem"
when    = ["-filesystem-read"]
message = "Use the available file-listing tool instead of ls."
```

`has = "filesystem"` checks that the `filesystem` MCP server is in the merged role config; `when = ["-filesystem-read"]`
checks that the `filesystem-read` *capability* has not been used yet in this session — two different namespaces working
together.

### Performance

Guards evaluate **in batch, in arrival order, before any tool spawns**. Each allowed call is recorded into the session
log so the next call in the same batch sees it via `when`, even before the earlier call has executed or succeeded.
Blocked calls never reach the executor — no time is wasted.

---

## `[[hook]]` — post-result scripts

```toml
[[hook]]
match  = "shell(command=^cargo build)"   # optional: filter on the call
result = "error\\[E\\d+\\]"              # optional: regex on result text
on     = "any"                           # optional: "success" | "error" | "any"
script = ".agents/hooks/cargo-summary.sh"   # required: path relative to workdir
```

### Semantics

- Fires after each tool result lands, after the ordinary tool batch completes and before truncation/condensation and
  model delivery.
- All matching hooks fire (no first-match-wins). Multiple hooks compose.
- Skipped for guardrail-blocked tools — their synthetic result is not a real result.
- Script runs with the tool context on stdin and environment. Exit 0 = no-op; exit ≠ 0 = stdout pushed to the session
  inbox (delivered as system-managed feedback on a subsequent request). Stdout is trimmed first; if it is empty after
  trimming, nothing is pushed even on a non-zero exit.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `match` | DSL target | no | call filter; empty/whitespace = any tool (skipped, treated as no filter) |
| `result` | regex | no | regex on the result text; `result = ""` compiles to a match-everything regex (unlike `match`, which skips empty), so it matches any result incl. empty |
| `on` | enum | no | `success`, `error`, or `any` (default) |
| `script` | path | yes | relative to workdir or absolute |

### Script contract

| Channel | Use |
|---|---|
| **cwd** | session workdir |
| **stdin** | JSON `{capability, tool, tool_id, params, result, success}` (`capability` = resolved capability name, or `null` if the tool isn't owned by any capability) |
| **env** | `OCTOMIND_CAPABILITY`, `OCTOMIND_TOOL`, `OCTOMIND_SUCCESS=1\|0`, `OCTOMIND_WORKDIR` |
| **stdout** | pushed to the session inbox if exit ≠ 0; trimmed first |
| **stderr** | debug-logged for non-zero exits, never injected; exit-0 stderr is not logged |
| **exit 0** | no-op |
| **exit ≠ 0** | trimmed stdout → inbox; if empty after trimming, nothing is pushed |
| **timeout** | 300 s; killed → no inject |

### Example: parse cargo errors after every build

```toml
[[hook]]
match  = "shell(command=cargo (build|test|check))"
result = "error\\["
script = ".agents/hooks/cargo-summary.sh"
```

Save this as `.agents/hooks/cargo-summary.sh` (requires `jq`) and make it executable:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
payload=$(cat)
errors=$(printf '%s' "$payload" | jq -r '.result' | grep -oE 'error\[E[0-9]+\]' | sort -u || true)
[ -z "$errors" ] && exit 0
printf '%s\n' "Build emitted: $errors. Inspect the diagnostics before continuing."
exit 1
```

```bash
chmod +x .agents/hooks/cargo-summary.sh
printf '%s' '{"capability":"shell","tool":"shell","tool_id":"build-1","params":{"command":"cargo check"},"result":"error[E0308]: mismatched types","success":false}' | .agents/hooks/cargo-summary.sh
```

This direct invocation should print the diagnostic message and exit 1; it does not run Cargo.

---

## `[[validator]]` — end-of-turn scripts

```toml
[[validator]]
name   = "test-before-done"
match  = "(?i)\\b(done|finished|completed)\\b"   # optional: regex on assistant message
when   = [                                        # optional: tool-history filter
  "+filesystem-write",
  "-shell(command=cargo test)",
]
roles  = ["developer"]                            # optional: role filter
script = ".agents/validators/remind-tests.sh"
```

### Semantics

- Fires once at the end of the assistant turn (after the model produces its final message with no further tool calls).
- Per-validator cursor into the session call log. `when` is evaluated against `call_log[cursor..]` — i.e. **calls since
  this validator last ran**. On run, cursor advances to `call_log.len()`.
- All filters AND'd. None set → fires every turn (skill-like).
- Guardrail validators run at the end of **every** assistant turn (subject only to the `roles`/`when`/`match` filters).
  They are a separate system from skill `SKILL.md` validate scripts and are **not** gated by the
  `[skills].auto_validation` config flag — that flag only controls skill validators.
- On exit ≠ 0, stdout is trimmed, then wrapped as `<validation validator="<name>">…</validation>` and pushed to the
  session inbox. If stdout is empty after trimming, nothing is pushed even on a non-zero exit.

### Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name` | string | yes | unique identifier, used for the cursor and the XML tag |
| `match` | regex | no | matched against the assistant's final message text |
| `when` | list of `+/-target` | no | history check vs the slice since last run |
| `roles` | list of strings | no | role filter; exact (`developer:general`) or domain prefix (`developer` matches `developer:general`; `developer:*` is not a glob) |
| `script` | path | yes | relative to workdir or absolute |

### Filter short-circuit order (cheapest first)

1. **role filter** — skip the validator entirely if the current session role isn't in the list.
2. **`when` filter** — slice the call log from this validator's cursor, run `+used / -unused` checks.
3. **`match` regex** — run the regex over the assistant's final message text.

Only validators that pass all three filters spawn their script. The cursor advances **when the async execution task is
scheduled**, before OS process-spawn success is known. A spawn failure, timeout, or non-zero exit still consumes that
history window.

### Script contract

| Channel | Use |
|---|---|
| **cwd** | session workdir |
| **stdin** | JSON `{validator, role, assistant_text, triggered_by:[{capability,params}, …]}` |
| **env** | `OCTOMIND_VALIDATOR`, `OCTOMIND_ROLE`, `OCTOMIND_WORKDIR` |
| **stdout** | trimmed, then wrapped + pushed to inbox if exit ≠ 0 |
| **stderr** | debug-logged for non-zero exits; exit-0 stderr is not logged |
| **exit 0** | no-op |
| **exit ≠ 0** | `<validation validator="<name>">stdout</validation>` → inbox; if stdout is empty after trimming, nothing is pushed |
| **timeout** | 300 s |

`triggered_by` lists the calls in the since-last-run slice that matched a `+used` target. When the validator has no
`+used` targets configured, it instead contains **every** call in that slice — i.e. everything that happened since this
validator last ran — so an always-on validator still sees the full window of activity.

### Example: nudge to check after edits

History cannot prove that tests passed: the negative shell condition below means no matching call was attempted, not no
successful run. The script asks the model to respect the user’s verification instructions.

```toml
[[validator]]
name   = "test-after-edit"
when   = ["+filesystem-write", "-shell(command=cargo test)"]
script = ".agents/validators/remind-tests.sh"
```

Save this as `.agents/validators/remind-tests.sh` and make it executable:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
printf '%s\n' "Edits were attempted without a recorded cargo test call. Follow the user’s verification instructions and report validation limits."
exit 1
```

```bash
mkdir -p .agents/validators
# Save remind-tests.sh above in this directory before running chmod.
chmod +x .agents/validators/remind-tests.sh
```

### Example: always-on response check

```toml
[[validator]]
name   = "validation-statement"
script = ".agents/validators/validation-statement"
```

No filters means it runs at every turn end through the shared response path. Save this complete script as
`.agents/validators/validation-statement`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import json
import sys
payload = json.load(sys.stdin)
if "validation" not in payload["assistant_text"].lower():
    print("Include a validation statement describing what you checked and what remains unverified.")
    sys.exit(1)
```

```bash
chmod +x .agents/validators/validation-statement
printf '%s' '{"validator":"validation-statement","role":"developer:general","assistant_text":"Changed the docs.","triggered_by":[]}' | .agents/validators/validation-statement
```

This direct check emits feedback and exits 1; include a validation statement to obtain exit 0. Guardrail validators have
no `[skills].max_retries` cap, so design scripts to stop emitting feedback once the issue is addressed.

---

## How history works (call log)

For ordinary tool batches, the session maintains a single ordered call log: `Vec<(capability, params)>`. Every
**allowed** tool call is appended before execution, so a call remains in history even if the external tool later returns
an error. Blocked calls are not recorded because they never execute.

- `[[guard]]` `when` reads the entire log (session-wide history).
- `[[validator]]` `when` reads `log[cursor..]` where the cursor is per-validator.
- `[[hook]]` doesn't use `when` — it's a per-result reaction.

These conditions track attempted calls, not outcomes. A `+shell(command=cargo test)` condition can be satisfied by a
failing test or an earlier allowed call in the same batch. Use actual script checks or tool results to establish
success.

The main-session single-call `tap` action `capability` has a special inline path that bypasses ordinary batch checks,
call-log recording, and result hooks. Guardrails are not a complete process or filesystem sandbox.

## Execution order

```text
User sends message
  ├── run_pipe (pre-model):
  │     evaluate [[pipe]] rules (roles → when → match)
  │     at most one pipe may match; multiple = error
  │     if matched → spawn script, stdin = user message
  │       exit 0 → stdout replaces user message
  │       exit ≠ 0 → hard stop, error displayed
  │     if no match → pass through unchanged
LLM receives (possibly transformed) user message
LLM emits tool calls [t0, t1, …]
  ├── check_batch (pre-call):
  │     for each ti in arrival order:
  │       resolve capability
  │       evaluate [[guard]] rules
  │       if blocked → don't spawn, return synthetic error
  │       if allowed → record in call log; execute after batch checks
  ├── join_all (parallel tool execution)
  ├── run_hooks (post-result):
  │     for each (call, real result):
  │       evaluate [[hook]] rules
  │       spawn matching scripts in parallel
  │       non-zero exits with non-empty (trimmed) stdout → inbox push
  ├── truncate large plain-text outputs, then supervisor condensation
  ├── return results to the LLM
LLM produces final assistant message (no more tool calls)
  ├── run_turn_validators:
  │     for each [[validator]] in declaration order:
  │       role filter → when filter → match filter
  │       survivors spawn scripts; advance their cursors immediately
  │         (cursor moves regardless of exit code — "the validator ran")
  │       collect outputs; non-zero exits → wrap + inbox push
Inbox feedback flows into a subsequent API request as system-managed user-role content
```

---

## Inbox routing

Hook and validator injections land in the **session inbox** — the same queue used by skill validators, scheduled
messages, webhooks, etc. The session loop drains the inbox before the next API request. Each non-zero-exit script with
non-empty trimmed stdout produces one inbox entry; entries are flushed in the order they were enqueued.

Inbox source kinds (the `source_kind` field in JSONL/WebSocket output) emitted by guardrails:

| Source | When |
|---|---|
| `guardrail_hook` | a `[[hook]]` script exited non-zero (with non-empty trimmed stdout) |
| `guardrail_validator` | a `[[validator]]` script exited non-zero (with non-empty trimmed stdout) |

These two values let you distinguish guardrail injections from the other inbox sources sharing the same queue —
`skill_validator`, `schedule`, `webhook`, `background_agent`, `tap_run`, `skill`, and `inject`. Grep the JSONL/WebSocket
stream by `source_kind` to filter for just guardrail output. See [WebSocket
Server](../integration/01-websocket-server.md) for the full structured-output schema.

---

## Authoring tips

- **Start permissive, tighten over time.** A wrong `[[guard]]` blocks real work; a wrong `[[validator]]` just nags.
  Prefer validators while iterating.
- **Use `+used / -unused` for conditional rules, not separate `[[guard]]`s.** Composing two rules with `when` is clearer
  than three rules with no history.
- **Keep scripts fast.** Hook and validator scripts run synchronously in the turn boundary; a 30-second script is a
  30-second pause. The 300 s timeout exists as a backstop, not a target.
- **stdout = the message, stderr = debugging.** If you're injecting noise, it consumes model context and can trigger
  another response. Feedback is system-managed, not a new user instruction. Be precise.
- **Check script behavior first.** Use the direct stdin examples above, then observe actual session injections. For
  example, with the validation-statement validator installed:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'Reply with the single word Hello.' | octomind run developer:general --format jsonl \
  | jq 'select(.type == "injected") | select(.source_kind == "guardrail_validator")'
```

This checks feedback events, not whether a guard denied a tool. Guards return tool errors rather than injected
hook/validator events, and model tool choice can vary.

## Differences from skills

| | Skill validators (`programming-rust`, etc.) | Guardrails (`[[validator]]`) |
|---|---|---|
| Source | `<tap>/skills/<name>/validate` | `.agents/guardrails.toml` (project) |
| Trigger | active skill plus enabled validation | declared in guardrails file |
| State | skill auto-activation | per-validator cursor into call log |
| Filter | always when skill active | `roles` + `when` + `match` |
| Gated by `[skills].auto_validation` | yes — the flag enables/disables skill validate scripts | no — guardrail validators always run at turn end |
| Wrapping | `<validation skill="…">` | `<validation validator="…">` |

They share the inbox path and the activation-by-failure pattern, but live at different layers — skills are reusable
across projects, guardrails are project-local policy.

## Common questions

**Why did the rule not load?** A parse error disables the authored file as a whole. Check TOML syntax, regex escaping,
signed `when` entries, and unique pipe/validator names. Start a new session and inspect debug output:

```bash
octomind config --log-level debug
octomind run developer:general
```

**Why does a deny rule not match?** Its target is a resolved capability name, not a tool name. Use the ownership hook
above; tools without an owner need an unfiltered hook or another enforcement mechanism. `has` checks config server
membership, and literal `developer` role filters match domain prefixes; `developer:*` is not supported.

**Why is script feedback absent?** Hooks/validators inject only non-empty stdout on non-zero exit. A timeout or spawn
failure does not inject repair feedback. Check executable permissions and the script path. The direct child is killed on
timeout; descendant process cleanup is not guaranteed.

**Do generated rules overwrite this file?** No. With learning evolution enabled, generated rules are appended after
authored rules through the same native runtime. Manage them with `/learning evolution`; see [Learning](13-learning.md).
