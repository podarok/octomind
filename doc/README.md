# Octomind Documentation

Use these guides to install, configure, and operate Octomind's CLI agent runtime, or to contribute to its Rust code.
Start with a terminal session, then follow the guides for automation, integrations, and development.

## Start Here

Install the binary and sign in to an Octomind account to use the shipped OctoHub model default:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://octomind.run/install.sh | bash
octomind login
octomind
```

`octomind login` asks you to confirm a code in the browser and CLI, then stores the hub key in the user-scope
`config/.env` and account credentials in `config/auth.json`. It does not change your model selection. New configs use
`assistant:concierge` as the default tag and `octohub:auto` as the model name. See
[Installation](usage/01-installation.md) and [Quickstart](usage/02-quickstart.md) for the complete setup.

## Configure

Inspect and validate your configuration before adding roles or tools:

```bash
octomind config --show
octomind config --validate
```

The default config is under `~/.local/share/octomind/config/` on Linux/macOS and `%LOCALAPPDATA%/octomind/config/` on
Windows. `OCTOMIND_DATA_DIR` relocates Octomind state; for example:

```bash
OCTOMIND_DATA_DIR="$PWD/.octomind-data" octomind config --show
```

Use [Configuration](usage/03-configuration.md) for file merging and overrides, or [AI
Providers](usage/04-providers.md#bring-your-own-keys) to supply provider credentials yourself.

## Operate

Create or resume a named interactive session:

```bash
octomind run --name project-review
# After exiting, continue the same session:
octomind run --resume project-review
```

Inside a session, discover commands and inspect active tools:

```text
/help
/mcp
/exit
```

For automation, pipe the prompt through stdin and choose `plain` or `jsonl` output:

```bash
printf '%s\n' 'Summarize the responsibilities of an MCP server in three sentences.' | octomind run --format plain
```

`run` takes a role/tag positional argument, not a message argument. See [Daemon &
Hooks](integration/03-daemon-and-hooks.md) for persistent workers and [Workflows](usage/09-workflows.md) for multi-step
runs.

## Common Questions

If the shell cannot find the binary after the default installation, add the installer directory to your current shell's
path:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
octomind --version
```

If login cannot open a local browser, print the URL instead:

```bash
octomind login --no-browser
```

If a piped command hangs, ensure its producer closes stdin; Octomind reads the complete prompt before starting. For
configuration and credential errors, start with `octomind config --validate` above and the guides below.
